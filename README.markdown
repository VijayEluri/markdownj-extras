Markdown Extras
================

Markdown Extras contains basic code implementations of common use cases of Markdown (a text-to-html conversion tool written by John Gruber), using the MarkdownJ library.

MarkdownJ is the pure Java port of Markdown.


Features
--------

*   MarkdownService

    A class which uses MarkdownJ library to transform markdown files, adding header and footer from classpath or filesystem or as text string.

*   MarkdownApp

    A basic application which uses MarkdownService to process recursively the markdown files in a given directory.


Prerequisites
-------------

Maven install of git://github.com/enr/markdownj.git version 0.4.M20100621.

    wget 'http://github.com/enr/markdownj/tarball/0.4.M20100621'


Building
--------

Git clone or download of the last version Jar at <http://github.com/downloads/enr/markdownj-extras/markdownj-extras-0.3.2.jar>.

Markdown App
------------

Usage (after mvn clean install):

    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.github.enr.markdownj.extras.MarkdownApp" \
    -Dexec.args="--header src/test/resources/site/templates/header.html          \
    --footer src/test/resources/site/templates/footer.html                       \
    --source src/test/resources/site/markdown                                    \
